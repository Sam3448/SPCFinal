## Introduction
This work is about deploying de-anonymize attack to users in social networks and propose a method to defend such attack. First, we propose a de-anonymizing attack based on the Jessica et.al, then we propose a defense method based on this method and implement experiments to show its efficiency. As to the result, most times of attacks fail to reveal the real users, which means the defense method is effective.

## Tool used
